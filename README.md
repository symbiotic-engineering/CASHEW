Repository for CASHEW project, submitted for the [DOE Power at Sea Prize](https://www.herox.com/PowerAtSea).

The CASHEW (CArbon Sequestration Harnessing Energy from Waves) system uses wave power to directly pump liquid carbon dioxide into the seabed,
reducing the cost of carbon sequestration. This repository contains the models used as well as many of the figures submitted to the prize.

Run our model:
- To run the Simscape model for transient pressure and flow, simply run the `runCASHEW.m` file in the `src/pump_model` folder. Then plot the results using the `plot_results.m` file in the same folder.
- To run the MATLAB model for steady state pressure and flow, run the `pressureTempCalc.m` file in the `src/energyAndTempCalcs` folder.
- To run the MATLAB economics model, run the `fom_sweep.m` file in the `src/econ` folder.
