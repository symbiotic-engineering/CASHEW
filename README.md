# CASHEW
Repository for CASHEW project, submitted for the power at sea prize.

CASHEW (CArbon Sequestration Harnessing Energy from Waves) aims to utilize wave energy in a direct drive way to sequester CO2. This repository contains the models used as well as many of the figures submitted to the prize.

To run the Simscape model, simply run the runCASHEW.m file in the src/pump_model folder. Then plot the results using the plot_results.m file in the same folder.
